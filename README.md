# 🌍 **Clustering Analysis on Air Quality Data**

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project performs **unsupervised learning (Clustering Analysis)** on **air quality data** collected from sensors. The goal is to identify patterns in **pollution levels** and categorize regions based on environmental conditions.

## 🔍 **Methodology & Steps**  

### 1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyzed feature relationships and identified trends in air quality measurements.  
- Used **pair plots** and **heatmaps** to visualize correlations between pollutants.  
- Discussed **ethical concerns** in environmental monitoring and public health impact.  

### 2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers.  
- **Feature Scaling:** Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical variables.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for visualization and feature selection.  

### 3️⃣ **Model Training & Clustering Techniques**  
Implemented two clustering models:  
✅ **K-Means Clustering**  
✅ **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**  

**Cluster Evaluation Metrics:**  
✔ **Silhouette Score** – Used to assess the quality of clusters.  
✔ **Dendrograms & Cluster Plots** – Visualized hierarchical clustering structure.  

### 4️⃣ **Model Evaluation & Business Insights**  
- Compared clustering performance of **K-Means vs. Agglomerative Clustering**.  
- Interpreted cluster results to identify **pollution hotspots** and air quality trends.  
- Suggested how **clustering insights** can help policymakers improve **environmental monitoring strategies**.  

## 🛠 **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Models:** K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering  
- **Feature Engineering:** PCA for dimensionality reduction  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Silhouette Score, Dendrogram Analysis  

## 📌 **Conclusion & Real-World Impact**  
✔ **K-Means clustering** effectively categorized air quality patterns based on sensor readings.  
✔ The insights from clustering can assist **governments & environmental agencies** in detecting **pollution hotspots** and monitoring trends over time.
